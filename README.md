# Legacy System Integration - Industrial Robotics 

## Ailton Dos Santos

### Calculated geometric parameters for legacy system integration in Industrial Roboto by:

- Making a graph of the robot when all joint angles are zero using the A matreces of tet=0

- Plotting the result, using the Px, Py and Pz given in TA1, TA12, TA123, TA1234, TA12345, TA123456

- Reachable working envelope

- Testing and calculating the T matrix using the theta values given
t1=0, t2=-40, t3=20, t4=45, t5=45, t6=60

- Making a graph of the robot position using the given theta angles

- Making the force varying with time
